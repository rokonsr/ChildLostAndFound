Child Lost &amp; Found Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks


Abstract
The loss of a child is a devastating experience for families, and current methods for locating and identifying lost children often face significant limitations in efficiency and scalability. This project, Child Lost & Found Detection Using Image Processing, presents an innovative solution by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and image processing tools to address this societal challenge.

The proposed system integrates the MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) algorithm for detecting facial features and the pre-trained FaceNet model for generating unique 128D facial feature vectors. By pairing these technologies with an XGBoost classifier, the system ensures high accuracy in identifying and matching children’s images with a centralized database of missing individuals.

A user-friendly graphical interface enables parents, law enforcement, and NGOs to report missing children, add details to the database, and perform real-time searches. The system also allows seamless retrieval of associated information, including coordinates, to facilitate swift reunification efforts.

This project addresses critical gaps in existing systems by providing a scalable, efficient, and technologically advanced solution to child recovery, demonstrating the transformative potential of AI in solving real-world problems.
